# Drowsiness Detection

## Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection project is a computer vision-based solution designed to monitor driver behavior in real-time. Using advanced deep learning techniques and image processing, the system detects early signs of drowsiness to help prevent accidents and enhance road safety.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously analyzes video streams to detect drowsiness.
- **Customizable Sensitivity:** Allows adjustment of detection thresholds to suit different environments.
- **Extensible Codebase:** Well-structured for future enhancements and contributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV:** For video processing and computer vision.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** Such as TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your model implementation).
- Additional dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
### Data Sources
Kaggle Dataset
For training and testing our machine learning models, we utilize a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes a wide variety of images and annotations capturing different driver behaviors and conditions. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd?resource=download-directory


### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
   cd driver-drowsiness-detection
