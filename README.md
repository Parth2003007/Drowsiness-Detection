# Drowsiness Detection

## Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection project is a computer vision-based solution designed to monitor driver behavior in real-time. Using advanced deep learning techniques and image processing, the system detects early signs of drowsiness to help prevent accidents and enhance road safety.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously analyzes video streams to detect drowsiness.
- **Customizable Sensitivity:** Allows adjustment of detection thresholds to suit different environments.
- **Extensible Codebase:** Well-structured for future enhancements and contributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV:** For video processing and computer vision.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** Such as TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your model implementation).
- Additional dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
   cd driver-drowsiness-detection
